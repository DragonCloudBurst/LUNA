# LUNA
a lightweight notepad application.

## Description
LUNA, or Lightweight Universal Notes Application, was originally created for myself because I couldn't find a plaintext editor that I liked enough. LUNA aims to provide a simple, no-nonsense way to create and edit text files. It can also import formats like .md and .rtf; however, please note that the exporting of rtf files has yet to be tested. txt and md files have been tested and should work smoothly with LUNA.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
- So far, I can say with absolute certainty that LUNA will function on Windows 11. I have not yet been able to test it on other versions of Windows, MacOS, or Linux.

### Installing / Executing
- You should not need to downlad anything else to run LUNA. Simply download the .exe and run it. Please let me know if you run into any issues.

## Technologies used (so far)
- C#
- WinForms
- Visual Studio
