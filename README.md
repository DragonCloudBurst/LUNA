# LUNA
a lightweight notepad application.

## Description
LUNA, or Lightweight Universal Notes Application, was originally created for myself because I couldn't find a plaintext editor that I liked enough. LUNA aims to provide a simple, no-nonsense way to create and edit text files. It can also import formats like .md and .rtf; however, please note that the exporting of rtf files has yet to be tested. txt and md files have been tested and should work smoothly with LUNA. 

As of 1.5, LUNA now has a button that will highlight basic markdown syntax when pressed. Please note that there is currently a small bug where, if your cursor is immediately next to or selecting characters such as *, #, etc, the next text you type will also be in that color. This is unintentional and I'm planning to fix it if I can. Furthermore, note that this will not actually break the file- the highlighting is just for the sake of visually discerning markdown. Pressing the button will not modify the file's actual text.
